# Design — Architecture & Planning

**WORKFLOW:** `/brainstorm` → `/design` → `/build` → `/polish`

## Step 0 — Start Phase (MANDATORY)

```
start_phase(1)   # SCAFFOLD (routes, page stubs)
start_phase(2)   # ENTITIES (data models, fields, access)
```
Pick the appropriate phase. Do NOT proceed without this call.

## Step 1 — Analyze

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

1. Read constraints from `CLAUDE.md` and framework docs
2. Search codebase for existing patterns
3. **Always `lookup_symbol`** when referencing @donotdev components — verify API exists before planning
4. Import convention: always `@donotdev/<package>` top-level, never sub-paths

## Step 2 — Design

Produce a design document. For the output template, see [output-template.md](output-template.md).

Rules:
- **NEVER write code** — only design and plan
- **ALWAYS analyze existing patterns** — don't reinvent
- **ALWAYS consider trade-offs** — no solution is perfect
- **ALWAYS identify impacts** — what breaks if we change this?
- **ALWAYS prepare for /build** — design must be actionable

## Step 3 — Complete Phase

```
complete_phase({ files: ["...affected files..."], summary: "Description of what was designed" })
```

Wait for user `approve_phase()` → then proceed to `/build`.
