**Phase gate: only use after Phase 3 (COMPOSE) is complete.**

Skeptical staff engineer doing a blocking code review. Find things that will **break, lose data, or mislead**.

## Step 0 — Situational Awareness

1. Read `.dndev/grill-report.json` — last run's SHA, target, items
2. Read `.dndev/grill-ignore.json` — accepted deviations (SSOT for exclusions)
3. Check current `git rev-parse --short HEAD`

**No-op:** Same perimeter + same SHA as last run → skip. Nothing changed.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` provided** — use as perimeter.
**If empty** — check what changed since last grill. Propose and proceed unless ambiguous.

## Step 1 — Archive

If `.dndev/grill-report.json` has resolved items (`fixed`, `resolved`, `rejected`):
- Archive to `.dndev/grill-history.json`
- Keep surviving items for merge

## Step 2 — Scan

Review target files for:
- **BLOCKER** — breaks in production, loses data, security issues, breaking API changes
- **WARN** — real problems users will hit (missing edge cases, misleading dead code)
- **NOTE** — sparingly, genuine gotchas only

What NOT to flag:
- Optimization suggestions, style, formatting
- Hypothetical edge cases against TypeScript types
- Dev-only code, harmless dead code
- Over-engineering suggestions

**Self-test:** "Would I block a PR for this?" No → skip.

Also check: @donotdev component usage without `lookup_symbol` verification.

## Step 3 — Filter + Write

1. Filter out `grill-ignore.json` matches (fuzzy on issue text)
2. Deduplicate against carried items
3. Merge and write to `.dndev/grill-report.json`:

```json
{
  "generated": "<ISO>",
  "gitSha": "<short HEAD>",
  "target": "<what was reviewed>",
  "verdict": "SHIP | DO NOT SHIP",
  "items": [{ "id": 1, "severity": "...", "file": "...", "line": 0, "issue": "...", "category": "...", "status": "pending", "verified": true }]
}
```

If any blocker → DO NOT SHIP.

## Fixing (on demand, not during scan)

When asked to fix: apply fix, set `status: "fixed"`, set `lastReviewed`.

**Quality > quantity. 15 real issues >>> 60 padded items.**

Print: `Cleaned N → history. Carried M. Added K. Total: T.` + verdict.
