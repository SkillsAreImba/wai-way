# Brainstorm — Requirements Extraction

**WORKFLOW:** `/brainstorm` → `/design` → `/build` → `/polish`

## Step 0 — Start Phase (MANDATORY)

```
start_phase(0)
```
Do NOT proceed without this call.

## Step 1 — Extract

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

Ask probing questions **one at a time**. Use MCP to discover framework capabilities.

| Extract | Questions |
|---------|-----------|
| **Vision** | What is this app? Who uses it? |
| **Users** | Roles? Permissions? |
| **Entities** | What "things" exist? Fields? Relations? |
| **Features** | What can users DO? MVP vs V2? |
| **Pages** | Screens? Routes? Access levels? |
| **Constraints** | Platform? Languages? Auth? Integrations? |
| **Native vs Custom** | What uses framework defaults? What needs custom? |

Rules:
- One question at a time — wait for answer
- Probe vague answers: "What does 'manage' mean?"
- Challenge scope: "What's the minimum to launch?"
- Summarize progress every 3-4 exchanges
- Never guess — ask

## Step 2 — Generate HLD

When all targets extracted, write to `docs/HLD.md` with: Vision, Users, Entities (fields + types + access), Features (MVP/V2), Pages (routes + access), Constraints, Native vs Custom, Open Questions.

**Validation before completing:**
- [ ] No empty sections or TBDs
- [ ] All entities have fields, states, permissions
- [ ] All business rules documented
- [ ] User has validated

## Step 3 — Complete Phase

```
complete_phase({ files: ["docs/HLD.md"], summary: "HLD complete — N entities, N pages, N features" })
```

Wait for user `approve_phase()` → then proceed to `/design`.
