description: Critical staff-engineer code review — flags problems before shipping
---

**Phase gate: only use after Phase 3 (COMPOSE) is complete.**

Act as a skeptical staff engineer doing a blocking code review.

Target: the last modified files in this session, or files passed as argument.

Evaluate for:
- Architectural anti-patterns (coupling, wrong abstraction layer, violation of existing conventions)
- Missing edge cases (null/undefined, empty arrays, concurrent updates, auth failure paths)
- Security issues (injection, unvalidated input at system boundaries, exposed secrets)
- Over-engineering (abstractions not earned by current requirements)
- Missing or incorrect TypeScript types
- @donotdev component usage without `lookup_symbol` verification

Rules:
- NEVER suggest fixes. Report problems only.
- NEVER skip BLOCKER items to be polite.
- If there are no issues at a severity level, omit that level entirely.
- **Quality > quantity. 15 real issues >>> 60 padded items.**

## Output — 3-step lifecycle

The grill report is a **living queue**. Each run cleans up resolved items, archives them, then appends new findings.

### Step 1 — Clean up + archive

Read existing `.dndev/grill-report.json`. If it exists and has items:

1. Separate items into **resolved** (`status` = `fixed`, `resolved`, or `rejected`) and **surviving** (`pending`, `fixing`, or any other status).
2. Append a history entry to `.dndev/grill-history.json` (read existing array or start with `[]`):
```json
{
  "date": "<now ISO>",
  "gitSha": "<short git HEAD>",
  "target": "<previous report target>",
  "verdict": "<previous report verdict>",
  "blockers": <previous blocker count>,
  "warnings": <previous warning count>,
  "notes": <previous note count>,
  "total": <previous items.length>,
  "resolved": <resolved count>,
  "carried": <surviving count>
}
```
3. Keep the surviving items — they carry over into the updated report.

If no existing report or no items, skip this step.

### Step 2 — Scan

Produce new findings from the target files. **Deduplicate** against surviving items from Step 1: if a new finding matches an existing item on `file` + `line` + `issue` (fuzzy match on issue text), skip it.

### Step 3 — Write report

Merge surviving items from Step 1 + new findings from Step 2. Re-number `id` fields sequentially starting at 1. Write to `.dndev/grill-report.json`:

```json
{
  "generated": "<now ISO>",
  "gitSha": "<short git HEAD>",
  "target": "<description of what was reviewed>",
  "verdict": "SHIP" | "DO NOT SHIP",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "severity": "blocker" | "warn" | "note",
      "file": "src/pages/Foo.tsx",
      "line": 42,
      "issue": "Short description of the problem",
      "context": "Optional: why this matters, what could go wrong",
      "category": "security" | "architecture" | "edge-case" | "types" | "dead-code" | "consistency" | "dx" | "docs" | "performance",
      "status": "pending",
      "verified": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Verdict is based on the **merged** items (carried + new). If any blocker exists → DO NOT SHIP.

### Field rules

- `gitSha` — Run `git rev-parse --short HEAD`. Required.
- `verified` — Always `true` in final output.
- New items always get `status: "pending"`. Carried items keep their existing status.

### Fixing findings

When asked to fix grill findings (not during a scan — during a separate fix request):

1. Apply the code fix.
2. Update `.dndev/grill-report.json`: set `status: "fixed"` on each resolved item.
3. Set `lastReviewed` to current ISO timestamp.

This ensures the report reflects reality. Next grill run archives fixed items to history.

### General rules

- NEVER suggest fixes. Report problems only — during a scan.
- NEVER skip BLOCKER items.
- **Quality > quantity. 15 real issues >>> 60 padded items** (for new findings — carried items don't count toward this cap).
- Group by file, sort by line number.
- After writing, print: `Cleaned N resolved items → history. Carried M items. Added K new findings. Total: T items.`
- Print verdict: SHIP / DO NOT SHIP.
