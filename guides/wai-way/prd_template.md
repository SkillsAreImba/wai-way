# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Version:** V1
> **Status:** Draft | Validated
> **Last Updated:** [date]
>
> This document is the WHAT — what users need, what the product does, what rules govern behavior.
> Produced by Phase 0 (BRAINSTORM) from `spec_template.md` conversation.

## 1. Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **App Name** | |
| **One-Line Description** | |
| **Primary User** | _(Who uses this daily?)_ |
| **Secondary Users** | _(Who else interacts?)_ |
| **Core Value** | _(What problem does it solve?)_ |
| **North Star Action** | _(The ONE thing users MUST do — max 2 clicks from home)_ |

## 2. User Journeys

> Most important section. Every page, entity, and rule traces back to a journey.

### Journey 1: [Name — e.g., "New User Onboarding"]

**Actor:** [User type]
**Goal:** [What they're trying to accomplish]
**Trigger:** [What starts this journey]

**Steps:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Success:** [What indicates completion]
**Failure:** [What could go wrong, how to handle]

---

### Journey 2: [Name — e.g., "Daily Core Task"]

**Actor:** [User type]
**Goal:** [What they're trying to accomplish]
**Trigger:** [What starts this journey]

**Steps:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Success:** [What indicates completion]
**Failure:** [What could go wrong, how to handle]

_(Add more journeys as needed — every core flow gets its own journey)_

## 3. Business Rules

> Explicit rules that govern behavior. If it's not here, it doesn't exist.

### [Entity/Feature] Rules

1. **[Rule name]:** [Description]
2. **[Rule name]:** [Description]

### Validation Rules

| Entity | Field | Rule |

| | | |

### Automatic Calculations

| When | Calculate | Formula/Logic |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| | | |

### Notifications/Triggers

| Event | Action | Recipients |
|-------|--------|------------|

## 4. Permissions Matrix

> Who can CRUD what, under what conditions.

| Entity | Create | Read | Update | Delete |
|--------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| | | | | |

_Conditions (e.g., "owner only when status = draft") documented per cell._

## 5. Edge Cases & Error Handling

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| User submits invalid data | |
| Network connection lost | |
| Concurrent edit conflict | |
| External service down | |
| User tries unauthorized action | |

---

## 6. Design Decisions & Overrides

> Intentional deviations from framework UX heuristics (3-click rule, 70/30 hierarchy).
> **FOR AGENTS:** If documented here, do NOT challenge during Build or Polish phases.

| Target (Page/Feature) | Override Description | Rationale |
